# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a Gallery section to the Masjid-e-Gausia Welfare website with a "सालाना जलसा 2026" (Saalana Jalsa 2026) album containing 4 uploaded event photos.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a Gallery section accessible via navigation header and footer links
- Create a "सालाना जलसा 2026" album/card within the Gallery section
- Display all 4 event photos in a responsive photo grid inside the album
- Serve photos as static assets from `frontend/public/assets/generated/`
- Add lightbox/enlarged view on photo click
- Style the section consistent with the existing ivory/champagne/gold palette and Devanagari typography

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can navigate to the Gallery section, open the सालाना जलसा 2026 album, view all 4 event photos in a grid, and click any photo to see an enlarged lightbox view.
