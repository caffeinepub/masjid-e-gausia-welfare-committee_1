# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Display the committee name next to the logo in the header and fix the spelling of "जौनपुर" throughout the frontend.

**Planned changes:**
- In the Header component, render the committee name text alongside (next to or below) the logo on the left side, visible on both desktop and mobile
- Replace all occurrences of "जैनपुर" with "जौनपुर" across all frontend files (Header, Footer, HeroSection, ContactSection, index.html, and any other component or config file)

**User-visible outcome:** The header now shows the committee name beside the logo, and the city name is correctly spelled as "जौनपुर" everywhere on the site.
