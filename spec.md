## Summary
**Goal:** Apply a dhani (muted, earthy dark green, ~#4a7c59) color theme consistently across the entire website, replacing the current primary green color.

**Planned changes:**
- Update CSS custom properties and Tailwind config to replace the current primary/forest green with the dhani color (#4a7c59 or closest olive-green equivalent)
- Apply the dhani color to the header/navbar background
- Update all primary CTA buttons (HeroSection, DonateSection, ContactSection) to use the dhani color
- Update section headings and decorative accents across all sections (About, Services, Announcements, Donate, Contact) to the dhani color
- Ensure no components retain the old primary green color

**User-visible outcome:** The website displays a cohesive dhani (earthy olive-green) color theme across all UI elements, including the header, buttons, headings, and accents.
