# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the gallery lightbox so photos open correctly when clicked, and append "Maharajganj Jainpur" to the organization name everywhere it appears.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix the lightbox in the GallerySection component so clicking a photo in the "Saalana Jalsa 2026" album opens the full-size image correctly, with working close and keyboard navigation
- Append "Maharajganj Jainpur" after "Masjid-e-Gausia Welfare Committee" in all locations: HeroSection, Header, Footer, index.html, and any other components where it appears

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click any photo in the gallery album and view it in a lightbox overlay, and the full organization name "Masjid-e-Gausia Welfare Committee Maharajganj Jainpur" is displayed consistently across the entire site.
