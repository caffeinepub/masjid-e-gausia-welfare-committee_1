  "summary": "The diff updates the CSS custom properties in index.css and the Tailwind config (tailwind.config.js) to use dhani (earthy olive-green, oklch(0.49 0.08 152) approximately #4a7c59) as the primary/forest color token. Component-level utility class references (bg-forest, text-forest, etc.) are preserved via the updated token, so header, hero, buttons, headings, dividers, and card borders should pick up the new color through existing class usage. All core acceptance criteria for REQ-1 appear addressed in the config/CSS layer. No files under frontend/src/hooks/ or frontend/src/components/ui/ were modified. No Hindi text content changes are evident.",
