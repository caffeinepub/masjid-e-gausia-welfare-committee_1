  "summary": "The diff correctly implements REQ-1 by setting the stat counter for 'समाज की सेवा में समर्पित' to 0 in AboutSection.tsx. The file summary confirms all four stat counters in the mission panel are now set to 0. However, the constraint says only the 'समाज की सेवा में समर्पित' stat should be changed, not other stats. The truncated diff shows multiple counters being zeroed, which may exceed the requested scope.",

      "reason": "The build request constraint explicitly states 'Only change the value of the समाज की सेवा में समर्पित stat to 0; do not modify any other stats or content.' The file summary states 'the stat counters... are now all set to 0', implying multiple stats were changed beyond what was requested.",
