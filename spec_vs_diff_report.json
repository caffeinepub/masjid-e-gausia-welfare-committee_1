  "summary": "The diff implements the Gallery section with the 'सालाना जलसा 2026' album, lightbox functionality, static image paths, navigation links in header and footer, and consistent site theming. All core acceptance criteria of REQ-1 appear to be addressed. The 4 image files themselves are not shown in the diff (likely saved as binary assets), but their paths are correctly referenced in the component.",
