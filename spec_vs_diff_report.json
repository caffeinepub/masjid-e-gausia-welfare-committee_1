  "summary": "The diff implements all five requirements comprehensively. REQ-1 (nav tab), REQ-2 (JamaCollectionSection component), REQ-3 (backend endpoints), REQ-4 (AdminPanel with three tabs), and REQ-5 (React Query hooks) are all present. One minor AC item from REQ-3 regarding explicit stable storage declaration is not clearly visible in the truncated backend diff, but the overall implementation appears complete.",

      "requirement": "Records persist across canister upgrades via stable storage",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo diff is truncated and does not show stable variable declarations for jamaCollectionsList or nextJamaCollectionId. It is unclear whether stable storage is explicitly used for the new Jama Collection data.",
