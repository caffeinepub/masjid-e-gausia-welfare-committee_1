  "summary": "The implementation covers all 8 requirements well. The backend Motoko actor implements stable storage for announcements and contact inquiries with appropriate CRUD operations. The frontend implements all required sections (Hero, About, Services, Announcements, Donate, Contact) with the Islamic geometric theme, correct color palette, and proper image assets. One minor concern is that the backend uses List (mutable) rather than explicitly 'stable' variables, which could affect upgrade persistence, but this is a Motoko implementation detail. The announcements are sorted most-recent-first in the frontend hook. All AC items appear satisfied.",
