  "summary": "The diff only modifies project_state.json (a metadata/tracking file) and marks the requirement as 'pending'. No actual implementation of the Admin Panel link in the hamburger menu was made in Header.tsx or any frontend component file.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add an 'Admin Panel' link/button inside the hamburger (mobile) menu in the Header component, visible only to authenticated admin users — consistent with the existing desktop admin button logic already present in Header.tsx.",
      "reason": "No changes were made to Header.tsx or any frontend component. The only modified file is project_state.json, which merely records the request as 'pending'. None of the acceptance criteria are fulfilled: no Admin Panel button added to hamburger menu, no role/auth check applied, no click handler to open admin panel and close menu, no styling added.",
